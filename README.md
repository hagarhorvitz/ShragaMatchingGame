# Shraga Matching Game

## Overview

Shraga Matching Game is a unique, personal project inspired by my own dog, Shraga, whose strong preferences toward other animals sparked the idea for this interactive AI-based matching game. The game challenges users to create and introduce new animals—either real or AI-generated—then discover if those animals could become friends with Shraga and other animals, based on a variety of personality traits and criteria.

Every user can submit their own animal via a rich "New Animal" form, answer a set of personality and behavior questions, and upload a real photo or use the power of the OpenAI API to generate a custom image (realistic or fantastical). The AI determines the level of compatibility between two animals, drawing on behavioral logic and fun rules derived from Shraga’s unique character and other animals characters.

As users progress, they unlock new gameplay features: adding more animals, playing against animals from the growing community database, and even unlocking advanced options and gamification layers based on their level of activity or registration status. In the future, the game may include premium features and community-driven content.

This project is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate and practice advanced programming skills—including server-side logic, secure database management, modern frontend development, working with both internal and external APIs (especially OpenAI), integrating AI-powered image and text generation, and building a secure, scalable, and maintainable codebase.


## Project Goals

- **Showcase End-to-End Development:** Demonstrate the creation of a full-stack, production-ready web application, covering backend, frontend, and database integration.
- **AI Integration:** Explore real-world usage of AI APIs, including prompt engineering, image generation, and dynamic data flows between server and client.
- **Creative User Experience:** Enable users to interact with and contribute to a dynamic, playful system that feels personal and engaging.
- **Secure and Scalable Architecture:** Apply best practices for authentication, secure data storage, and scalable design.
- **Learning and Growth:** Practice clean code organization, modular design, and collaborative-friendly project structure for ongoing development and future expansion.
- **Personal Passion:** Combine creativity, coding, and love for animals in a project that’s both fun and a meaningful portfolio piece.


## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework (Python)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript, Vite)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (for image and text generation)


## Game Description

- Each user can create or upload a new animal, answering a detailed questionnaire about the animal's traits.
- Images can be uploaded directly or generated via AI (using the OpenAI API), allowing for both real and imaginative animals.
- The game compares each new animal’s traits against Shraga’s preferences and history, deciding—using both logic and AI—whether Shraga would befriend this animal.
- User progression unlocks new gameplay modes, more animal slots, and special features. Registration, repeat play, and active participation are rewarded with expanded access.
- The game is designed to be playful, personal, and endlessly creative, offering a fun introduction to AI-driven logic and interaction.


## User Interface

The main interface provides:
- A user-friendly “New Animal” and "Update Animal" form for submitting animals and customizing their personalities
- Each user enjoys a personal "My Animals" dashboard, providing full control to view, edit, and manage all of their animals.
- Options to upload real images or generate AI images
- Instant feedback and results on compatibility with Shraga
- A growing community of animals and options to play with the entire database


## Personal Note

This project is deeply personal, inspired by my relationship with my dog Shraga and my passion for coding, AI, and product design. It is intended to showcase a wide range of development skills—from backend logic and database design, to secure API integration, to modern and accessible frontend development.
